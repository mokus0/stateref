-- |This module exports no new symbols of its own.  It defines 
--  basic class instances for creating, reading, and writing 'TVar's and
--  (if available) 'TMVar's, and re-exports the types for which it defines 
--  instances as well as the 'atomically' function, which is indispensible
--  when playing with this stuff in ghci.
--
--  Note that this module declares incoherent instances.  The universe should
--  refrain from imploding on itself as long as you don't define
--  \"instance MonadIO STM\".  However, hugs doesn't seem to support 
--  overlapping instances, so I may have to give up on the dream of MonadIO 
--  everywhere, or introduce some major conditional compilation stuff. (or
--  abandon hugs support)
